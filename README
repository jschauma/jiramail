Atlassian's Jira ticketing system requires per-project email addresses to
be set up in order for users to be able to reply to ticket mail and get
their response added as a comment.  Instead of jumping through these
hoops, jiramail allows you to simply pipe your email into it, and it will
post the comment using the Jira API instead.

Requirements:
	- python (presumably > 2.5)

	- install -c -m 444 doc/jiramail.1 /somewhere/in/your/manpath/man1/jiramail.1
